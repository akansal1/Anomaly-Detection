# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
###### July 2016

This notebook documents a series of experiments in anomaly detection on a time-series of measurements from a municipal water tank. It is inspired by the techniques described in [*Practical Machine Learning: A New Look at Anomaly Detection*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034650.do) by Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman, and realized in Python by [*Matthew Rahtz*](http://amid.fish/anomaly-detection-with-k-means-clustering).

In [*Part One*](https://github.com/mclarknc/Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Anomaly%20Detection.ipynb) I define the problem and develop the anomaly detection technique. In [*Part Two*](https://github.com/mclarknc/Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Anomaly%20Detection%20-%20Smoothing.ipynb) I refine the anomaly detection technique by applying smoothing to the data. In [*Part Three*](https://github.com/mclarknc/Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Practice.ipynb) I apply the technique to simulated anomalous data.
