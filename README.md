# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
###### July 2016

This notebook documents a series of experiments in anomaly detection on a time-series of measurements from a municipal water tank. It is inspired by the techniques described in [*Practical Machine Learning: A New Look at Anomaly Detection*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034650.do) by Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman, and realized in Python by [*Matthew Rahtz*](http://amid.fish/anomaly-detection-with-k-means-clustering).
